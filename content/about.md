# Who am I?

My name is **Iraj Eshghi**, and I'm a physicist. I'm interested in building physical models of the (cancer) genome, its structure, evolution, and dynamics. I'm also generally interested in the physics of soft, biological, or active systems. I am currently working as a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [New York Genome Center](https://www.nygenome.org/), supervised by Profs. Marcin Imielinski and Gamze Gursoy.

Welcome to my website! You can find my scientific articles under the [publications](/boxes-and-squiggles/pubs) page. On the [blog](/boxes-and-squiggles/post), I intermittently post about topics which I'm currently learning or thinking about. These range from [popular science](https://softbites.org/author/ieshghi/), to [organizing and politics](https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/labor-special-issue/power-struggles/), with bits of [baking](/boxes-and-squiggles/post/11-14-2023-bread/), social theory, movies, literature, and whatever hobbies I may be losing myself into along the way.

I aim to follow the guidelines set out by George Orwell in his essay [Politics and the English Language](https://faculty.washington.edu/rsoder/EDLPS579/HonorsOrwellPoliticsEnglishLanguage.pdf), but most importantly I aim to follow his last guideline:
> Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous.

Publications are on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DnLtmq0AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Orcid](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4527-7578) accounts, and (some of my) code is on [Github](https://github.com/ieshghi).
