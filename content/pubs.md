# Popular science writing

I wrote a few articles for the popular science outlet [Softbites](https://softbites.org/author/ieshghi/) as a graduate student. I list them below for completeness' sake.

## 2021

- “I don’t think there will be a return journey, Mr. Frodo”: how thermodynamic irreversibility makes life flourish. *Softbites*, [full text link](https://softbites.org/2021/03/10/thermodynamic-irreversibility-origin-of-life/)

- Who needs polymer physics when you can get worms drunk instead?. *Softbites*, [full text link](https://softbites.org/2020/12/07/study-polymer-physics-with-drunk-worms/)

## 2020

- Lifehack: How to pack two meters of chromatin into your cell’s nucleus, knot-free! *Softbites*, [full text link](https://softbites.org/2020/08/26/chromatin-fractal-globule/)

# Other published work

In my time at NYU I was involved with several efforts to organize graduate students, both [within our physics department](https://physics.nyu.edu/gphorce/) as well as in our graduate worker union, [GSOC](https://makingabetternyu.org/). In the article below I wrote about this experience, as part of Science for the People's "Organize the Lab" project.

## 2022

- Power Struggles: Material and Cultural. *Science For the People*, [full text link](https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/labor-special-issue/power-struggles/), [link to the full issue](https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/organize-the-lab/).

I continue to help edit issues of Science for the People Magazine, and am always excited to hear about and discuss the intersection of science, labor, and social justice work.
